Input:
Array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Element to find = 30

Explanation:
Traverse the array from index 0 and compare each element with the target value; when a match is found return its index otherwise return -1 if the element is not present.'''


list=[10,20,30,40,50]

for i in range(0,l):
    if list[i]==key:
        index=i
        print(f"Index {key} found at index {index}")
        break;
